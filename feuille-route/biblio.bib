%% Bertrand : Source code optimization and profiling of energy consumption in embedded systems
@inproceedings{citeulike:5700744,
    abstract = {{This paper presents a source code optimization methodology and a profiling tool that have been developed to help designers in optimizing software performance and energy in embedded systems. Code optimizations are applied at three levels of abstraction: algorithmic, data and instruction-level. The profiler exploits a cycle-accurate energy consumption simulator [3] to relate the embedded system energy consumption and performance to the source code. Thus, it can be used for analysis (i.e., to find energy-critical sections of the code), and for validation (i.e., to assess the impact of each code optimization).Code optimizations and profiling tool are used to optimize and tune the implementation of an MPEG Layer III (MP3) audio decoder for the SmartBadge [2] portable embedded system. We show that using our methodology and tool we can quickly and easily redesign the MP3 audio decoder software to run in real time with low energy consumption. Performance increase of 92\% and energy consumption decrease of 77\% (over the original executable specification) has been achieved for MP3 audio decoding on the SmartBadge.}},

    abstract = {{Lexical functions (LF) model relations between terms in the lexicon. These relations can be knowledge about the world (Napoleon was an emperor) or knowledge about the language (↩destiny ↪ is synonym of ↩fate↪). In this article, we show that LF instanciation in texts is useful both for semantic analysis (for example, resolution of lexical ambiguities or prepositional attachment and synthesis, i.e. natural language generation. We describe the architecture of a Semantic Lexical Base and the way how LFs are modeled, detected and used. More precisely, we show how each LF is modelled using thematic (conceptual vectors) and lexical (materialised relations between database objects) information and how we exploit the results in the base. We also describe how these functions allow the database to be explored continuously rather than in a discrete way.}},

    abstract = {{Lexical and semantic information are difficult to collect either automatically or manually, and as being instrumental in many (if not all) NLP applications, there is a serious bottleneck for advances in this research field. In this paper, we propose a novel approach by making people play some king of associative word games. Doing so, we can memorize associations where a pair of players agrees. We present the principles of the game and some insights of the data collected so far.}},
